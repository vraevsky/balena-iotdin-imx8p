                We currently have many `8cpu` runners available that are

                migrating from Jenkins that we should allow to use for yocto
                builds.


                As long as some runners don't have the `yocto` tag so we don't
                bottleneck the runner queue for other orgs.

                        Users may specify dnsu2t config by including a `dns`
                        field

                        in the `proxy` section of PATCH /v1/device/host-config's
                        body:

                        ```

                        {
                          network: {
                            proxy: {

                        }

                        ```


                        If `dns` is a string, ADDRESS and PORT are required and
                        should be

                        in the format `ADDRESS:PORT`. The endpoint with error
                        with

                        code 400 if either ADDRESS or PORT are missing.


                        `dns` may also be a boolean. If true, defaults will be
                        configured.

                        If false, the dns configuration will be removed.


                        If `proxy` is patched to empty, `dns` will be removed
                        regardless

                        of its current or input configs, as `dns` depends on an
                        active

                        redsocks proxy to function.

                        The following pattern

                        ```ts

                        async function longRunning() {
                           // do something
                           await setTimeout(delay);
                           await longRunning();
                        }

                        ```


                        Is regularly used for long running operations on the
                        supervisor (e.g.

                        polling target state). We have

                        recently discovered that this pattern can slowly leak
                        memory as it

                        essentially creates an infinite promise chain. Using
                        `void longRunning()` breaks

                        the chain and avoids the issue.


                        This commit fixes all those instances where the pattern
                        was used.

                        The balena logging backend now uses async functions to
                        setup the

                        connection and write messages to the request stream.
                        This adds some

                        backpressure on `log` calls by by the log monitor
                        module, to prevent a

                        very agressive container causing the supervisor to waste
                        CPU cycles just

                        dropping messages.

                        This removes the dependence of the supervisor on the
                        containerLogs

                        database for remembering the last sent timestamp. This
                        commit instead

                        uses the supervisor startup time as the initial time for
                        log retrieval.

                        This might result in some logs missing for services that
                        may start

                        before the supervisor after a boot, or if the supervisor
                        restarts.

                        However this seems like an acceptable trade-off as the
                        current

                        implementation seems to make things worst in resource
                        contrained

                        environments.


                        We'll move storing the last sent timestamp to a better
                        storage medium in

                        a future commit.

                The beagleplay is unable to load u-boot from the sd-card

                boot partition if the standard geometry set by mkfs.vfat is used
                -

                that is 16 heads / 63 sectors per track.


                We noticed that using a geometry of 16 heads / 32 sectors per
                track

                make the device to boot from the sd-card, so we make the

                boot filesystem options configurable from the device repository

                to apply this setting.

                The "All jobs" job is used for branch protection
                as it captures the overall success/fail of all
                the test matrices and build.

                However without a unique name we are unable
                to identify the device type in order to mark it as required.

                This change adds a single instance matrix
                to the build job and as a result will append the machine
                name and deploy environment in the job name.

                        the function that was being used to fetch the DUT ip
                        from the worker had nested retries that led to 30x5 =
                        150 retries, and timeouts taking ~40 mins in the case
                        the DUT wasn't reachable (autokit setup fault, device
                        not booting, problem during flashing). This removes the
                        nested retries and reduces the retries to 50 /  ~ 10mins
